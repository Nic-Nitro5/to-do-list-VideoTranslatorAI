            In my pursuit of new endeavours, I would like to take the time to introduce myself to your organisation. My name is Nicholas Paul Mantzivis and I am a Developer Programmer from South Africa. I am confident that my experience in building web applications, coding knowledge and technical skills have provided me with the credentials needed to thrive in Australia's development industry.
            The natural beauty, extensive variety of cultures and successful education systems of Australia play a huge part in our plan of action to make the move to 'the land Down Under'. It provides me peace of mind by giving my family a sense of safety and stability, which results in creating a brighter future for them. We are committed to starting a new chapter there, as the country has intriguing opportunities and a high standard of living that includes great healthcare as well as financial prosperity. As it has one of the most promising economies in the world, I appreciate the opportunity to be involved within this ever-growing market.

            The advancement of technology fuels my desire to further myself in this field, and I am eager to create applications that are beneficial to society. Throughout my career, I have demonstrated skills using web languages such as CSS, JavaScript, HTML, Typescript, PHP, C# and SQL that allow users to access and interact with sites. I completed many different types of specs including payment gateways, API's, hotel and travel features, property management features, voting and eLearning. Prior to my current role at Gordian Logistics, I held a Full Stack role in the past where I cultivated strong business logic and became particularly well-versed in user experience. I have recently proceeded to asset management, which involves rigorous math to provide clients with the best spending advice throughout a financial year and drastically reduce costs. In my new position, I am exceptionally looking forward to communicating with inspiring people in a positive work environment. Furthermore, as a diligent individual with an analytical mindset, I trust that I can contribute to your organisationâ€™s effectiveness by sharing my expertise in e-commerce features. I understand the value of team coordination and look forward to continuing to establish a strong corporate platform within the company.

            As the intention is to invest in a country with an encouraging future, settling our lives in Australia would be a dream come true. Since it has been our objective for numerous years, we are thoroughly delighted to be a part of this inviting nation. I enthusiastically look forward to hearing from you and thank you for you.
