# ToDoList

A simple todo list application which allows a user to register and login, create, delete, complete and translate todo items from english to French. If the user has a admin flag set to true in the database, they can view the admin section. The admin section displays the list of users and their history.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.2. It relies on endpoints from the to-do-list-API (see: https://github.com/Nic-Nitro5/to-do-list-VideoTranslatorAI-API) project built in .NET & C#.

## Production Server

* Run `ng build` for the app to be bundled minified version (faster and lighter). This will create a `dist` folder.
* Create a YAML file  

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
